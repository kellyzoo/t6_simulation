# T6 Simulation Pipeline

In this library, we provide a simulation pipeline in order to accurately model the T6, a next-generation computational camera developed by the University of Toronto. The T6 features a dual-tap design, and allows for per-pixel encoded subexposures. The goal of this simulation model is to provide users with an efficient way to accurately prototype the cameraâ€™s functionality and results, for use in a variety of applications. 

In this library, we overview the steps required to capture training data, learn the camera's noise parameters, and run the simulation.

## Noise modelling

### Theory
Here, we briefly overview the various learned components of our noise model. 

Consider that our clean input image is $I_{in}$ $[DN]$ (normalized to a 12-bit range), our camera's saturation level is $I_{max}$ $[DN]$, and our simulated exposure time is $t$ $[\mu s]$.

#### Gain
Let $g$ be our constant per-pixel gain parameter. We multiply $I_{in}$ by $g$ in order to account for gain variations across the sensor in our final noisy result.

#### Fixed pattern noise (FPN)
Let $h$ be our constant per-pixel FPN parameter. We add $h$ to our final noisy result.

#### Shot noise
Shot noise normally follows a Poisson distribution with respect to the number of arrived photons. In order to learn our shot noise parameter, we instead choose to approximate this with a Gaussian distribution, which is differentiable with respect to its mean and variance. Let $\lambda_{shot}$ be our sensor-wide shot noise parameter. If our sensor is not saturated (i.e. $I_{in} \cdot g + h < I_{max}$), we add $N_{shot} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu = 0, \sigma^2 = \lambda_{shot}^2 \cdot I_{in} \cdot g^2)$ to our final noisy result. Otherwise, we simply add $N_{shot} = 0$.

#### Read noise
Let $\lambda_{read}$ be our per-pixel read noise parameter. We add $N_{read} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu = 0, \sigma^2 = \lambda_{read}^2)$ to our final noisy result.

#### Row noise
Let $\lambda_{row}$ be our sensor-wide row noise parameter. We add $N_{row} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu = 0, \sigma^2 = \lambda_{row}^2)$ to our final noisy result. Note that each row shares the same Gaussian distributed random variable.

#### Temporal row noise
Let $\lambda_{row_t}$  be our sensor-wide temporal row noise parameter. We add $N_{row_t} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu = 0, \sigma^2 = \lambda_{row_t}^2)$ to our final noisy result. Note that, in addition to each row sharing the same Gaussian distributed random variable, each image in a consecutive burst also shares the same variables.

#### Quantization noise
Let $\lambda_{quant}$ be our sensor-wide quantization noise parameter. We add $N_{quant} \sim \mathcal{U}(\frac{-\lambda_{quant}}{2}, \frac{\lambda_{quant}}{2})$ to our final noisy result.

#### Dark current
Like shot noise, dark current also follows a Poisson distribution, but instead with respect to time. For the same reasons as before, we also choose to approximate this with a Gaussian distribution. Let $\lambda_{dark}$ be our per-pixel dark current parameter. We add $N_{dark} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu = \lambda_{dark} \cdot t, \sigma^2 = \lambda_{dark} \cdot t)$ to our final noisy result.

#### Final noisy result
Putting all of our noise sources together, we get out final noisy result, $I_{out}$:
$$I_{out} = I_{in} \cdot g + h + N_{shot} + N_{read} + N_{row} + N_{row_t} + N_{quant} + N_{dark}$$
